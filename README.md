# üöÄ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD | Week 0: Setup & Tools Installation

Welcome to the launch pad of your SoC journey! In Week 0, we set the foundation for transforming RTL designs into silicon by preparing your development environment with essential open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. This crucial step ensures a smooth and robust experience as we dive deeper into chip design and tapeout phases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What You Achieved This Week:
- **Installed and configured core EDA tools:**  
  - **Yosys:** RTL synthesis from Verilog to gate-level netlist ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yosys-‚úì-green)  
  - **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** Reliable Verilog simulation and verification ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/IcarusVerilog-‚úì-green)  
  - **GTKWave:** Waveform viewer for analyzing RTL simulation outputs ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/GTKWave-‚úì-green)  
- **Verified toolchain functionality** with successful simulation and synthesis runs
- **Prepared an environment** tailored for RTL-to-GDSII flows on Ubuntu 20.04+ (native or VM)
- **Built confidence** for moving forward into SoC integration and silicon tapeout

## üåü Why This Matters:
Building silicon is a complex journey requiring precise tools and workflows. Week 0 empowers you by setting up proven open-source software ecosystems essential to design, simulate, and synthesize your RISC-V SoC efficiently. These tools are cornerstones of industry-grade chip design, enabling innovation at a fraction of traditional cost.
