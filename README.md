The “RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program” offers a complete, hands-on journey to design, implement, and fabricate a RISC-V SoC using industry-grade tools and a PDK.
It is crafted for students, educators, and professionals aiming to master the full chip development process — from RTL design to post-silicon validation.
It runs for 20 weeks, includes 20+ IPs, and guarantees 100% tapeout.
The program delivers an end-to-end flow: RTL → GDSII → post-silicon validation.
