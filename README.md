# 🧑‍💻🔧 RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program VSD | Week 0: Setup & Tools Installation

Welcome to the launch pad of your SoC journey! In Week 0, we set the foundation for transforming RTL designs into silicon by preparing your development environment with essential open-source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. This crucial step ensures a smooth and robust experience as we dive deeper into chip design and tapeout phases.

## ⚙️ This Week’s Highlights
- **Installed and configured core EDA tools:**  
  - **Yosys:** RTL synthesis from Verilog to gate-level netlist ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Yosys-✓-green)  
  - **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** Reliable Verilog simulation and verification ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/IcarusVerilog-✓-green)  
  - **GTKWave:** Waveform viewer for analyzing RTL simulation outputs ![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/GTKWave-✓-green)  
- **Prepared an environment** tailored for RTL-to-GDSII flows on Ubuntu 20.04+ (native or VM)
- **Built confidence** for moving forward into SoC integration and silicon tapeout
